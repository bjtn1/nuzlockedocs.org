# Welcome!

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)

Welcome to ***Nuzlocke Docs***! I'm glad you made it here! :D

## What is this?

This is a website that puts together documentation for pokemon games (vanilla and rom hacks) such as line ups for pokemon trainers, level caps, item locations, and more!

Additionally, the website also includes resources for each pokemon game available such as damage calculators, and how to install and update certain rom hacks.

The website also provides the user with information on the rules of ***nuzlocking*** such as the different types of nuzlockes, clauses in nuzlockes, and more!


## Who made this?

The website was originally created by me [(Brandon Jose Tenorio Noguera)](https://github.com/bjtn1), a Pokemon fan and computer science student

## Why make this?

The website was originally made to make it easier to navigate through documentation for a rom hack called Pokemon Radical Red. As I progressed with the website, I realized I could repurpose it to include documentation for other rom hacks, as well as provide nuzlocking resources to new players looking to get into it.

## Sources

The vast majority of the information on this website is taken from other sources. Each and every page will contain a a blue info box like
:::info
This one!
:::

where the source for that specific page was retrieved from.

This is my very first time making something like this, and it is NOT my intention to steal credit for the marvelous information that other people have written.

If you have written or helped write any of the sources that I cite, and would like to be given credit in a different way, you can email me (see my github page or [my website](https://bjtnoguera.netlify.app/) on how to reach me), or you can open an issue on the [GitHub repo for this website](https://github.com/bjtn1/nuzlockedocs.org) and we can talk there!

### How I obtain my sources
Although most of the information for rom hacks can be found by a simple Google search, I try to obtain permission from the official developers (or anyone with authority) of a rom hack before adding their documentation to this website.
